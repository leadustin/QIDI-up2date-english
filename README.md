# **Qidi Up2date**
This repository is about updating the Qidi Series 3 to the latest software including some useful and optional tools as well as the conversion of the original display to a new display running on the Klipperscreen.
Currently the guides are compatible with the Qidi X-Max 3 and the X-Plus 3.

For the complete conversion of the printer, you should follow this guide. It describes how to update the printer's old software to the latest version.
